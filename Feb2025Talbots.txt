the chic 
jean jacket
the tailored 
A-line skirt
Today’s denim is the 
ultimate multitasker. 
Think tailored for 
work or casual for 
play. Make a head-
to-toe statement or 
grab a chic jacket 
and go. The fashion 
possibilities (and 
make no mistake: 
denim is fashion!) 
are endless. It’s 
never been easier to 
do denim your way.

casual
A feminine jean jacket casualizes 
a flowy dress. A pintuck trouser 
jean creates a long line and 
brings effortless balance to a 
ladylike sweater jacket. We love 
both with a chic flat.
